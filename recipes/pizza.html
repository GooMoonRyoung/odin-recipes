    <p>Pizza is a popular dish that originated in Italy and is made from a flatbread topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and a variety of other ingredients such as meats, vegetables, and seasonings. Pizza is typically baked in an oven and can be served in slices or as a whole pie. The most basic pizza is a Margherita, which consists of a simple tomato sauce, cheese, and fresh basil. However, over time, many different variations of pizza have emerged, including pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, and veggie pizzas, to name just a few.</p>
