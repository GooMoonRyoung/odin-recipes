    <p>Lasagna is a traditional Italian dish consisting of alternating layers of pasta, sauce, cheese, and fillings. The pasta is typically flat, wide noodles that are baked in a casserole dish. The sauce is typically a tomato-based sauce, although other sauces such as meat or cream sauces are also used. The cheese used in lasagna is typically mozzarella, but other cheeses such as ricotta or parmesan can also be used. Fillings can include meat, such as ground beef or sausage, vegetables, or a combination of both.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Lasagna is a hearty and comforting dish that is popular for its rich flavor and satisfying texture. It is often served as a main dish, although it can also be served as a side dish or as part of a larger meal. Lasagna can be prepared in advance and stored in the refrigerator or freezer for later, making it a convenient dish for busy families and individuals. In addition, lasagna is a versatile dish that can be adapted to suit different tastes and dietary restrictions, such as vegetarian, gluten-free, or low-fat versions. Despite its rich and indulgent nature, lasagna can be made healthier by using whole grain pasta, lean meats, and plenty of vegetables.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Cook the Meat: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the meat until browned, breaking it up into small pieces as it cooks. Drain any excess grease</li>
        <li>Add the Onion and Garlic: Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet and cook until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season the Meat Mixture: Stir in the sugar and spices and seasonings of your choice into the meat mixture. Add the tomato product and let the mixture simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna: In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of the dish. Place 3 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Spread a layer of ricotta cheese over the noodles, followed by a layer of mozzarella cheese. Repeat this layering process until all of the ingredients are used, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Bake the Lasagna: Beat the egg in a small bowl and brush it over the top layer of mozzarella cheese. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Serve: Allow the lasagna to cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
